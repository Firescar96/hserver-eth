    <p>Transactions fall into two basic types. Message transactions transfer
       value and data and can invoke contracts. Contract creation transactions
       register code on the blockchain, to later be invoked by messages.

       For purposes of this tutorial, the meaningful difference is that contract creation
       transactions lack a "To Address." If you'd like your contract to have executable code
       associated with it, you should write it in one of Ethereum's high level languages,
       compile it, and include the compiled hex as the data field.

    <p>Transactions require numerous fields, which have meanings that aren't always obvious.
       A transaction is a signed message, originating from an address. The address is an
       160 bit integer associated with the public key of the signer. The nonce is a piece of
       data associated with that address, indicating how many transactions that address has
       previously propagated. For your transaction to be accepted, you need to use the correct
       nonce. We will explain later how to look that information up with our API.

       The gas price and gas limit are data that reflect the cost of computation on the blockchain.
       As is the case for Bitcoin, every Ethereum participant must process every valid transaction
       sent to the network. As transactions can contain executable code, there must be a means of
       limiting the total amount of computation a particular transaction imposes on the network.

       Ethereum solves this problem by introducing the notion of gas. Gas is meant as a unit of
       computational work. A computation is metered by the gas price, up to a maximum total expenditure
       of the gas limit.

    <p>Message Transactions sent to an address come with a data payload and some Ether (value).
       If the to field of the message contains a contract, that contract is automatically invoked
       on the data. 

    <p>
      Function invocation is slightly tricky. Take the ABI output from the solidity compiler,
      and supply the function name and a list of arguments, and the data payload for the transaction
      will appear in the data field. You still need to provide the destination address.
