    <h2>API documentation</h2>
    <p>Many of the functions below take an "apiURL", which indicates
    from what server the API queries are to be obtained.  If running a
    server locally, "" is allowed; the canonical one is
    "http://stablenet.blockapps.net".
    <ul>
      <li>Contract object: api.Contract(address, functionABI,
        symbolTable).  It has the properties:
        <ul>
          <li>address: the address of the contract object, assigned at
            creation.
          <li>nonce: the address's nonce, current as of the last call
            to sync(), described below.
          <li>balance: the address's balance, current as of the last
          call to sync().
          <!-- <li>makeCall(functionName, args).  Forms the data string to -->
          <!--   be sent in an Ethereum transaction to call the function with -->
          <!--   the given arguments. -->
          <li>sync(apiURL, callback): this asynchronous function reads
            the blockchain (via the REST api exposed at
            stablenet.blockapps.net) to determine the current nonce,
            balance, and state variable values of the address.  The
            callback (which takes no arguments) is then invoked.
          <li>vars: an associative array whose properties are the
            names of all Solidity state variables of the contract, as
            described in the symbolTable argument to the constructor.
            These properties are interpreted as reasonable Javascript
            types:
            <ul>
              <li>bool: Boolean
              <li>address: String (of the form "0x..." with 40 hex
                digits)
              <li>uint/int: (any bit size) a BigInt, from the
                big-integer library.
              <li>bytes: (any bit size or dynamic) a string,
                containing the hex representation of the bytes.
              <li>string: a string.  Note that bytes and string are
                currently not correctly implemented in solc.
              <li>contracts: Contract object.  This is not currently
                implemented.
              <li>structs: JS object whose properties are the fields
                of the struct.
              <li>arrays: JS array of the values as their associated
                JS objects.
              <li>mappings: a function taking an elementary type (in
                its JS representation) and returning the associated
                value (also in JS representation).  This is not
                well-tested currently.
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>api.getContract(apiURL, code, privKey, gasPrice, gasLimit,
        callback): the actual interface for constructing a Contract
        object from Solidity code.  This compiles the code, submits it
        as a contract creation transaction from the address owning the
        private key, extracts the necessary data to interpret the
        variables (the "symbol table" argument, symtab, to Contract),
        and creates the contract object.  This new contract is passed
        to the callback.
      <li>api.compile(apiURL, code, callback).  Submits the code to
        the online Solidity compiler, returning the output to the
        callback function.  This output is an object of the form
        {contracts: [{name: contractName, bin: compiledCode}], abis:
        [{abi: contractFunctions}], xabis: {contractName:
        storageLayout}}.  The contractFunctions object is defined by
        Solidity; the storageLayout format varies depending on the
        variable type but always contains fields "bytesUsed" and
        "solidityType".  Some of its entries are type declarations;
        the actual variables have the field "atStorageKey" as well.
      <li>api.submit(apiURL, compiledCode, privateKey, gasPrice,
        gasLimit, callback).  Submits compiled Solidity code via the
        given URL, using the parameters provided.  The response is in
        the form of a comma-separated string of new addresses for the
        contracts it creates, which is returned to the callback.
      <li>api.getContractsCreated(apiURL, txHash, callback).
        Retrieves the list of contracts created (as in api.submit) by
        the transaction whose hash is txHash, and returns it to the
        callback.
      <li>api.pushTX(nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, toAddress, ethValue,
        data, privateKey, URL, callback).  Sends a transaction to the
        URL (canonically "/includetransaction") with the given
        parameters, handing the response to callback.  This response is
        simply the query URL to look up the raw transaction
        ("http://stablenet.blockapps.net/query/transaction?hash=txHash"),
        which is probably not what you want.  Thus, callback should
        probably extract txHash and GET from "/transactionResult/txHash"
        to obtain more detailed information.
